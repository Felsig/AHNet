### Hello!
Currently, [adamhilton.net](http://adamhilton.net) is just a 1 page site that I used to test out running an ASP.NET Core 1.0 app targeting the Core CLR on a linux server.
My goal is to create a blogging engine targeting the Core CLR that anyone can use. I'm licensing this project under the [MIT license](LICENSE), 
so feel free to use my code however you want or contribute!
